<div class="content"><h1>Functions</h1>
<p>In the introduction to unileq, we showed how to perform several higher level operations, like
comparing values. Even though we can perform these useful operations, we may need to write out
dozens of unileq instructions to do so. Rewriting these instructions every time we need them is both
messy and prone to errors.</p>
<br>
<p>In this section, we will solve this problem by creating a calling convention for functions. These
functions will allow us to reuse other instructions with very little effort on out part, and they
can be implemented within unileq. That is, we don't need to introduce any new assembly notation or
macros.</p>

<!--
<p>It would be nice to use the code blocks above without needing to rewrite them every time we need
them. In some assembly languages we could hide them in an assembler macro, and in high level
languages we could create a function construct. However, using a special convention, we can create
our own easy to use function calling mechanism from entirely within unileq.</p>
<br>
<p>We will continue to use the shorthand <i>[x]</i> to represent <i>mem[x]</i>, or the value at
memory address <i>x</i>. Now, assume that the label <i>func</i> is the function we want to call, and
address <i>0</i> always holds the value <i>0</i> when we begin. Then the function calling format we
will use is:</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">0 ? func arg0 arg1 ...</div>
<br>
<p>When the unileq instruction <i>0 ? func</i> is executed, it will perform the operation
<i>[0]=[0]-[?]</i>. Since <i>?</i> refers to the current address in memory, <i>[?]=?</i>. Also, by
our assumptions, <i>[0]=0</i>. Thus, we have <i>[0]=0-?</i>. That is, we store the negation of the
current address in memory address <i>0</i>. And since <i>0</i> will always be less than or equal to
any other value, we will always jump to <i>func</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>Now that our instruction pointer has jumped to <i>func</i>, we will want to parse the arguments
that we are passing: <i>arg0 arg1 ...</i> etc. Since we know that address <i>0</i> holds the
negative of the address of the where the function was called from, and that the arguments are listed
immediately after the calling address, we can retrieve <i>arg0</i> at <i>-[0]+2</i>, <i>arg1</i> at
<i>-[0]+3</i>, and so on.</p>
<br>
<p>In other words, using this format, we can use the memory addresses after the calling unileq
function to act as a stack and hold the arguments we want to pass to the function. Furthermore, we
will know to return to the address immediately after the arguments in order to resume program
flow.</p>
<br>
<p>The unileq program below creates a function called <i>print</i> which can be called to print a
zero terminated ascii string. For instance, we could print "ABC" using <i>0 ? print 65 66 67 0</i>.
</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">0 0 main  #Jump to main

print:
     #Print function. Prints a zero terminated ascii string.
     #Arguments: 0 ? print char0 char1 char2 ... 0
       .ptr   .ptr   ?+1  #Store the calling address+2 in ptr
       .ptr  .neg2   ?+1
       .ptr      0   ?+1
.loop:    0      0   ?+2  #Loop through each character
.ret:     0               #Return using "0 0 .ptr"
          0 .ptr:0   ?+1
       .ptr  .neg1   ?+1  #increment [ptr]
          0  .char  .ret  #if [0]=0, return
      .char      0   ?+1  #[char]=[[ptr]]
        0-1  .char   ?+1
      .char  .char .loop
.char:    0
.neg1:  0-1
.neg2:  0-2

main:
     #print test\n
     0 ? print 112 114 105 110 116 32 116 101 115 116 10 0

     #Hello, World!\n
     0 ? print 72 101 108 108 111 44 32 87 111 114 108 100 33 10 0

     #exit
     0 0 0-1
</div>
<br>
<p>Note the use of sublabels, such as <i>.char</i>, under the <i>print</i> label. This defines the
sublabel under the scope of the parent label and helps us avoid label name collisions in larger
unileq programs.</p>
<br>
<p>The <i>print</i> function also uses a few tricks to remain small, but with some rearranging it
might still be possible to remove an instruction from the function.</p>
