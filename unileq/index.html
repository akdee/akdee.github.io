<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Unileq Architecture ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<div class="content"><h1>The Unileq Architecture</h1>
<p>Download the interpreter here: <a href="./unileq.c">unileq.c</a></p>
<br>
<p>Unileq is an architecture that is meant to show how minimal a computer can be and still work.
Whereas most computer architectures have hundreds or thousands of different instructions that can be
used to build a program, unileq has only one. Its one instruction is simple: it performs a
subtraction and then jumps. Despite its simplicity, we can use this instruction to create any
program we want. Unileq is based off of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subleq">subleq</a> architecture.</p>
<br>
<p>To execute a unileq instruction, we first load 3 operands: <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>. We
then subtract the value at address <i>B</i> from the value at address <i>A</i>. If the value at
<i>A</i> was less than or equal to the value at <i>B</i>, then we jump to <i>C</i>. Otherwise, we
load the next 3 operands after <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>We keep track of the memory we're executing with the instruction pointer, <i>IP</i>, which is
set to <i>0</i> at the start of the program. The pseudocode below shows the main unileq loop:</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock">while true
	A=mem[IP+0]
	B=mem[IP+1]
	C=mem[IP+2]
	if mem[A]&lt;=mem[B]
		IP=C
	else
		IP=IP+3
	endif
	mem[A]=mem[A]-mem[B]
endwhile
</div>
<br>
<p>The instruction pointer and all memory values are 64 bit unsigned integers. Overflow and
underflow are handled by wrapping values around to be between <i>0</i> and <i>2^64-1</i>
inclusive.</p>
<br>
<p>If <i>A=2^64-1</i>, then instead of executing a normal instruction, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> will be
used to interact with the interpreter. For example, if <i>C=0</i>, then the interpreter will end
execution of the current unileq program.</p>
<br>
<h2>Unileq Assembly Language</h2>
<br>
<p>We can write a unileq program by setting the memory values directly, but it will be easier to
both read and write a unileq program by using an assembly language. Because there's only one
instruction, we can omit any notation specifying what instruction to execute on some given memory
values. We only need to specify what values will make up the program, and the unileq instruction
will be executed on whatever values the instruction pointer is pointed to.</p>
<br>
<p>An outline of our language is given below.</p>
<br>
<table class="datatable headerrow">
<tr><td>Component</td><td>Description</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>#comment</i></td><td>Single line comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>#|
	comment
|#</i></td><td>Multi line comment.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>?</i></td><td>Inserts the current memory address.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Label:</i></td><td>Label declaration. Declarations mark the current memory address for
later recall. Declarations can't appear within an expression, ex: <i>0 label: +1</i>. Duplicate
declarations are an error.<br>
<br>
Labels are case sensitive and support UTF-8.<br>
First character: <i>a-zA-Z_.</i> and any character with a high bit<br>
Trailing characters: <i>a-zA-Z_.0-9</i> and any character with a high bit</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Label</i></td><td>Inserts the memory address marked by <i>Label:</i>. There must be
whitespace or an operator between any two label recalls or numbers.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>.Sublabel</i></td><td>Shorthand for placing a label under another label's scope. Ex:
<i>lbl:0 .sub:1</i> will be treated as <i>lbl:0 lbl.sub:1</i> internally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Number</td><td>Inserts the number's value. A number must be in decimal or hexadecimal
form, such as <i>123</i> or <i>0xff</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Operator <i>+-</i></td><td>Adds or subtracts the number or label from the previous value.
Parentheses are not supported. To express a negative number, use its unsigned form or the identity
<i>0-x=-x</i>.
<br>
There cannot be two consecutive operators, ex: <i>0++1</i>. Also, the program cannot begin or end
with an operator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Interpreter Calls</td><td>If <i>A=-1</i>, a call will be sent to the interpreter and no jump
will be taken. The effect of a call depends on <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>.<br>
<br>
<i>C=0</i>: End execution. <i>B</i> can be any value.<br>
<i>C=1</i>: <i>mem[B]</i> will be written to stdout.<br>
<i>C=2</i>: stdin will be written to <i>mem[B]</i>.</td></tr>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Hello, World! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<div class="content"><h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>We can show how the unileq assembly language and architecture work with a simple program that
prints "Hello, World" to the screen:</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">loop: len one  exit  #Decrement [len]. If [len]&lt;=1, exit.
      0-1 text 1     #Print a letter.
      ?-2 neg  loop  #Increment the text pointer and restart the loop.
exit: 0-1 0    0

text: 72 101 108 108 111 44 32  #Hello,
      87 111 114 108 100 33 10  #World!
len:  len-text+1
one:  1
neg:  0-1
</div>
<br>
<p>The first 3 lines of the program define a loop, and at each iteration of the loop we print a new
character. Below the loop is a command to exit the program, followed by all of the data we need to
make the program work.</p>
<br>
<p>For brevity, we will use <i>[x]</i> as shorthand for <i>mem[x]</i>, the value at address
<i>x</i>. With that said, we can now describe what each line does.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">loop: len one  exit</div>
<br>
<p>The first line declares the label <i>loop:</i> to mark the memory address of where our loop
starts. It also contains the instruction <i>len one exit</i>. When this instruction is executed, it
will take the values at memory addresses <i>len</i> and <i>one</i>, subtract them, and store the
result back at <i>len</i>. That is, it will perform <i>[len]=[len]-[one]</i> which evaluates to
<i>[len]=[len]-1</i>. Also, if <i>[len]</i> is less than or equal to <i>[one]</i> (before
subtracting), then we will jump to <i>exit</i> and end the program.</p>
<br>
<p>Thus, when the program is running, we expect it to count from <i>len-text+1</i> down to <i>1</i>
and then exit.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">      0-1 text 1</div>
<br>
<p>The second instruction of our loop has <i>-1</i> as the first operand, which specifies an
interpreter call. When the interpreter encounters an interpreter call, it won't execute a normal
unileq instruction. Instead it will perform some special action depending on the second and third
operands. Since the third operand is <i>1</i>, the interpreter will print <i>[text]</i> to the
screen.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">      ?-2 neg  loop</div>
<br>
<p>The third instruction is used to advance to the next character to print and restart the loop.
Recall from the assembly specification that <i>?</i> refers to the current address, so <i>?-2</i>
refers to two memory addresses back. In this case, it points to the previous instruction where
<i>text</i> is. When this instruction executes, <i>-1</i> will be subtracted from <i>text</i>, which
will have the effect of advancing to the next character that we want to print. Since we are using
unsigned arithmetic, <i>[neg]=-1=2^64-1</i> will be greater than or equal to any other value. Thus
this instruction will always jump to <i>loop</i> and restart the loop.</p>
<br><div class="codeblock langunileq">exit: 0-1 0    0</div>
<br>
<p>The last instruction of our program is another interpreter call, since <i>-1</i> is the first
operand. In this case, having <i>0</i> as the second operand will tell the interpreter to end the
program. Note, we do not specifically need to use <i>0-1</i> as the first operand. Any expression
that evaluates to <i>-1</i>, such as <i>2-3</i>, will also work.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">text: 72 101 108 108 111 44 32
      87 111 114 108 100 33 10</div>
<br>
<p>Here we define the ASCII character codes for the text "Hello, World!", plus an end-of-line
character.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">len:  len-text+1</div>
<br>
<p>This line is a quick and dirty way of calculating the length of the text we want to print. We
need to add <i>1</i> to the length since we abort at <i>1</i> instead of <i>0</i>.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">one:  1
neg:  0-1</div>
<br>
<p>And the last 2 lines define the constants <i>1</i> and <i>-1</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>This section appears to be rather long, given that we are going over a simple program. However,
it is only long because it is meant as an introduction, and we are trying to be thorough with
explanations. The next section will be more terse.</p>
</div>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Synthesized Instructions ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<div class="content"><h1>Synthesized Instructions</h1>
<p>Although printing text to the screen is easy, we will need to synthesize more complicated
instructions to serve as building blocks when we make more complicated programs. In future articles,
we will also show how to turn these synthesized instructions into easy to call functions from within
unileq. For now, we are only focusing on basic instructions in order to show how the unileq
architecture works.</p>
<br>
<p>For these code blocks, assume memory address <i>0</i> always starts with the value <i>0</i>, and
<i>tmp</i> is some temporary address. At the end of every block, we must ensure that address
<i>0</i> is restored to <i>0</i> if it's modified. We will also continue the use of <i>[x]</i> as
shorthand for <i>mem[x]</i>, the value at address <i>x</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>Up first is one of the most common instructions, an unconditional jump to <i>dst</i>.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">0 0 dst</div>
<br>
<p>We can abort any unileq program by using an interpreter call with <i>0</i> as the second operand.
A call is any instruction that has <i>-1</i> as the first operand. Note that we need to calculate
<i>-1</i> as <i>0-1</i> due to the syntax our assembly language.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">0-1 0 0</div>
<br>
<p>Jump to <i>dst</i> if <i>[a]=[b]</i>. The series of <i>?+1</i> expressions points to the next
memory address after the instruction. They simply serve to force the instruction pointer to go to
the next instruction regardless of whether or not the unileq function would jump.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">0   b   ?+1  #[0]=-[b]
tmp tmp ?+1  #[tmp]=0
tmp 0   ?+1  #[tmp]=-[0]=[b]
tmp a   ?+1  #[tmp]=[b]-[a]
0   0   ?+1  #[0]=0
tmp 0   dst  #if [tmp]=0, then [a]=[b], so jump
</div>
<br>
<p>Jump to <i>dst</i> if <i>[a]&gt;[b]</i>.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">0   a   ?+1  #[0]=-[a]
tmp tmp ?+1  #[tmp]=0
tmp 0   ?+1  #[tmp]=-[0]=[a]
0   0   ?+1  #[0]=0
tmp b   ?+4  #skip next instruction if [a]&lt;=[b]
0   0   dst  #[a]&gt;[b], jump
</div>
<br>
<p>We can print the character "A" to the screen by using an interpreter call with <i>1</i> as the
third operand, and the address of the character as the third operand. We define <i>char</i> to be
the ASCII code for "A".</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">0-1 char 1
char: 65
</div>
<br>
<p>Negate <i>[a]=-[b]</i>, even if <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are the same memory address.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">tmp tmp ?+1  #[tmp]=0
tmp b   ?+1  #[tmp]=-[b]
0   tmp ?+1  #[0]=-[tmp]=[b]
a   a   ?+1  #[a]=0
a   0   ?+1  #[a]=-[b]
0   0   ?+1  #[0]=0
</div>
<br>
<p>Set <i>[a]=[b]</i>.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">0 b ?+1  #[0]=-[b]=-[b]
a a ?+1  #[a]=0
a 0 ?+1  #[a]=-(-[b])=[b]
0 0 ?+1  #[0]=0
</div>
<br>
<p>Add <i>[a]=[a]+[b]</i>.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">0 b ?+1  #[0]=-[b]
a 0 ?+1  #[a]=[a]-[0]=[a]+[b]
0 0 ?+1  #[0]=0
</div>
<br>
<p>Increment <i>[a]</i>.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">a neg ?+1  #[a]=[a]-[neg]=[a]-(-1)=[a]+1
neg: 0-1
</div>
<br>
<p>Decrement <i>[a]</i>.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">a one ?+1  #[a]=[a]-[one]=[a]-1
one: 1
</div>
<br>
<p>Dereference <i>[a]=[[b]]</i>. This is an extremely useful technique that allows us to perform the
same actions on different memory addresses. It will form the backbone of functions in unileq.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">0   b     ?+1  #[0]=-[b]
ptr ptr   ?+1  #[ptr]=0
ptr 0     ?+1  #[ptr]=[b]
0   0     ?+1  #[0]=0
0   ptr:0 ?+1  #[0]=-[[b]]
a   a     ?+1  #[a]=0
a   0     ?+1  #[a]=[[b]]
0   0     ?+1  #[0]=0
</div>
<br>
<p>If we allow a unileq instruction to be atomic, we can actually create a spinlock. When the lock
is first acquired, the value of <i>[lock+1]</i> is overwritten from <i>dif</i> to
<i>dif-[dif]=dif+1</i> and we jump to the critical section. When a second thread tries to acquire
the lock, it will subtract <i>[dif+1]=0</i> from <i>dif+1</i>, which will fail to jump, and the
thread will be caught by the next instruction, <i>dif+1 dif+1 lock</i>. When the owning thread is
done with the lock, it just needs to subtract <i>[dif+2]=1</i> from <i>[lock]</i> to allow the lock
to be acquired by a new thread.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">lock: ?+1    dif   crit  #acquire lock
      dif+1  dif+1 lock  #failed to acquire, try again
crit: #
      # critical section
      #
      lock+1 dif+2 ?+1   #reopen spinlock
      dif+1  dif+1 dst   #jump
dif:  0-1 0 1
</div>
</div>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Architecture Properties ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<div class="content"><h1>Architecture Properties</h1>
<p>Unileq belongs to the family of one instruction architectures, like the
<a href="https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~parhami/pubs_folder/parh88-ijeee-ultimate-risc.pdf">subleq</a>
architecture it's based off of. This section will go over the theoretical and practical properties
that unileq has. First, however, it is necessary to outline the differences between unileq and
subleq.</p>
<br>
<p>Whereas subleq uses 2's complement signed arithmetic, unileq uses unsigned arithmetic. There are
several reasons for this:</p>
<br>
<table class="listtable">
<tr><td>&bull;</td><td>We may use the entire address range, instead of only the non-negative
addresses subleq allows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&bull;</td><td>When reimplementing integer and bitwise arithmetic, we can perform bit-by-bit
comparisons much more easily with unsigned integers. In particular, with signed integers we would
have to make a separate comparison for the high bit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&bull;</td><td>In unsigned arithmetic, if <i>A&gt;=B</i>, then we know that
<i>A-B&gt;=0</i>. This does not hold in signed arithmetic.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&bull;</td><td>Using the instruction <i>x 0 dst</i>, we can test a variable for equality
with <i>0</i> using only one instruction and without modifying any variables. This type of
comparison is common in software, and cannot be done in one instruction using subleq.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&bull;</td><td>We can perform another common operation, increment and jump, using only one
instruction, <i>x neg1 dst</i>, which is also not possible in subleq</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>Unileq also uses a different order for operands. With unileq, for operands <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>,
and <i>C</i>, we take <i>[A]=[A]-[B]</i>, where subleq takes <i>[B]=[B]-[A]</i>. The order of
operands in subleq is perfectly valid, of course, but goes against the standard ordering used in
mathematics. For example, we usually write <i>a=b+c</i> instead of <i>b+c=a</i>. In an early version
of unileq, I used the subleq order of operands and found myself constantly having to reorder the
operands in my head. Thus I decided swap the roles of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>So, with comparisons done, we can now go over the properties of the unileq architecture.</p>
<br>
<h2>Self Modifying</h2>
<br>
<p>Compared to modern architectures which prevent the modification of code for security reasons,
unileq programs require some amount of self modification to do anything useful at all. This can most
easily be seen in the "Hello, World!" program in the section above. Specifically, the lines</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">0-1 text 1     #Print a letter.
?-2 neg  loop  #Increment the text pointer and restart the loop.</div>
<br>
<p>Here we must modify part of an instruction where <i>text</i> is in order to print successive
characters in a string.</p>
<br>
<p>We can use this self modifying property to generate some simple programs at run time, or make a
self interpreter that counts the number of instructions used by another unileq function. However,
more complicated self modification, like that seen in Lisp, would be difficult to perform in
unileq.</p>
<br>
<h2>Interpreter Calls</h2>
<br>
<p>As part of the unileq specification, using <i>-1</i> as the first operand executes an interpreter
call instead of a normal instruction. Without this, a unileq program would have no way to display
its results or interact with its host computer. It would effectively be a brain in a vat. There's no
real way around this, given our one instruction limit.</p>
<br>
<p>Some consideration was taken as to how to interact with the interpreter. One choice was to map
specific memory addresses to specific actions, such as writing to address <i>0x1234...</i> to
display a pixel on the screen. Others were to set <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, or <i>C</i> to <i>-1</i> to
trigger some special action. Setting <i>B</i> didn't make much sense, since it's in the middle of
the instruction. Setting <i>C</i> could lead to problems, since we might want to use <i>C</i> to
store data if we know that a branch won't be taken. This left setting <i>A</i> to <i>-1</i> to call
to the interpreter.</p>
<br>
<p>By comparison, most subleq implementations will end execution by jumping to <i>-1</i> and
interact with stdout by writing to <i>-1</i>. In other words, using <i>-1</i> in different operands
for different effects. Our choice to use <i>-1</i> in the first operand for all abnormal effects
allows us to expand unileq to interact with the host in other ways, such as displaying pixels to the
screen, without needing to define even more special memory addresses.</p>
<br>
<h2>Turing Complete</h2>
<br>
<p>I claimed at the beginning of the article that unileq can do anything that a more complicated
architecture can do. I will prove this by showing that unileq can replicate the operations in
Minsky's <a href="http://www.cba.mit.edu/events/03.11.ASE/docs/Minsky.pdf">Computation: Finite and
Infinite Machines</a>, and by doing so, show that unileq is Turing complete.</p>
<br>
<p>Let <i>regn</i> denote some register and let the following assembly code initialize our
program.</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">0 0 start
neg1:0-1
pos1:1
reg0:0
reg1:0
reg2:0
#...
start:
</div>
<br>
<p>We have the operation <i>regn'</i>, which increments register <i>regn</i> and jumps to the next
instruction. In unileq, this can be performed by</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">regn neg1 ?+1</div>
<br>
<p>And we have the second operation, <i>regn<sup>-</sup>(n)</i>, which jumps to some memory address
<i>n</i> if <i>regn=0</i>, otherwise it decrements <i>regn</i> and jumps to the next instruction. In
unileq, this can be performed by</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock langunileq">regn 0 n
regn pos1 ?+1</div>
<br>
<p>Thus, unileq is Turing complete.</p>
<br>
<h2>One Instruction</h2>
<br>
<p>This is also a good place to mention a common criticism I have come across in forum postings
while doing my research. That is: how can you say that a unileq (or subleq) instruction is "one"
instruction when it does so many things? After all, it performs a subtraction and then jumps, so it
should at least count as two instructions.</p>
<br>
<p>The most important thing to consider is the spirit of the architecture. Most architectures have
a variety of instructions to perform a variety of actions. A unileq program is meant to be composed
of one simple instruction, and the goal is to do something a normal architecture would do. If we get
tied up by the definition of the architecture, then we'll lose the spirit of it.</p>
<br>
<p>That being said, we can create a formal definition of what "one instruction" actually means. The
definition uses a simplified version of
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/comparchampsite/Home">Laplante and Gilreath's</a> complexity
calculation: Given a set of memory addresses, is it possible to execute more than 1 instruction on
those memory addresses. For instance, consider addresses <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. In a complex
architecture we could execute<br>
<br>
<div class="codeblock">add A,B
sub A,B
mul A,B
...
</div>
<br>
<p>etc, all on the same memory addresses. Whereas with unileq, given <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and
<i>C</i>, we always execute the same instruction. This definition offers a better argument in my
opinion, although it can be circumvented by mapping instructions to memory addresses as in transport
triggered architectures.</p>
</div>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Notes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<div class="content"><h1>Notes</h1>
<p>Since writing this, the interpreter has been improved in a few ways:</p>
<br>
<table class="listtable">
<tr><td>&bull;</td><td>All memory allocation (ex: <i>malloc()</i>) is checked for failure.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&bull;</td><td>The parser underlines the section of text that yields an error.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&bull;</td><td>The parser checks for non-terminated block quotes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&bull;</td><td>The parser uses a hash map instead of an AVL tree for matching
labels.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&bull;</td><td>Memory is held in a flat array instead of an AVL tree. When profiling a
unileq math library, the flat array was almost 100 times faster.</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>The main downside with using a flat array to hold memory is that a lot of it can be dead space.
Although the array will grow if we try to access a memory address outside of its current allocation,
for speed reasons the array will not check if it can be shrunk. Using a paged memory system may
offer a decent balance between speed and wasted space. It would be used like so:</p>
<br>
<div class="codeblock">val=mem[addr>>48][(addr>>32)&0xffff][(addr>>16)&0xffff][addr&0xffff]</div>
<br>
<p>However, testing on large applications will need to be done.</p>
<br>
<p>Create an animated heat map showing memory activity. This would be useful in showing how the
architecture works to casual observers.</p>
<br>
<p>To support multithreading, make each instruction atomic. The interpreter can spawn threads with
a specific interpreter call. The new thread would start at <i>[B]</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>Within the language, make a bitwise and integer arithmetic library. Also see if there is a self
synchronizing sequence of instructions. That is, if the <i>IP</i> were to randomly land anywhere in
this block of memory, could we always direct it to some safe memory address?</p>
<br>
<p>Unileq's name comes from "UNsigned Integer subtract and branch if Less than or EQual to".
Although "uni" implying "one" is a nice coincidence.</p>
<br>
<p><a href="./testing.zip">testing.zip</a> contains my unfinished work, as well as test cases for
the <a href="./unileq.c">unileq.c</a> interpreter.</p>
